Comparing the Distribution of Pre-NPRS Scores to Post-NPRS Scores:
The Post-Treatment NPRS distribution is now clearly showing the frequency of different pain scores without the overlapping colors or “thin and thick” lines from before. Here’s how to interpret this improved histogram:

Interpretation -- There is Shift in Pain Levels:

Compared to the Pre-Treatment NPRS histogram, which showed higher pain levels (mostly around 7–9), this post-treatment distribution has shifted to the lower end of the scale, with most scores clustered around 1–3.
This suggests that many participants reported a reduction in pain after the treatment.

Interpretation -- Pain Reduction Success:

The highest frequencies are at 2 and 3, with some individuals even reporting a pain score as low as 1.
This indicates a significant improvement for several participants, as they moved from higher pain levels to much lower scores post-treatment.
Remaining Higher Scores:

A few participants still have scores in the 5–7 range, suggesting that while the treatment was effective for many, it did not fully alleviate pain for everyone.

A Note on the Group Variables:

# Display the metadata about the Group variable to facilitate accurate interpretation
print(meta.column_names_to_labels) # Shows labels for each column
print(meta.value_labels) # Shows mappings for categorical variables 

* Couldn't find the exact meaning of Group (1 v. 2) in the SAV file - however, through interpretation of a similar study by the same authors, I inferred the following:
# Group 1: Likely represents the experimental group (active tDCS + TENS)
# Group 2: Likely represents the control group (sham tDCS + TENS).

Box Plot Interpretation:

Active tDCS + TENS:
The median NPRS score is around 3 with a relatively narrow interquartile range, indicating less variability within this group.
Most scores are clustered between 3 and 4, suggesting that this group had consistent post-treatment pain relief.

Sham tDCS + TENS:
The median NPRS score is around 4, with a wider spread in scores, ranging from 1 to 7.
This variability could indicate that participants in this group had more varied responses to the sham treatment.

Possible Conclusions:
The Active tDCS + TENS group appears to show slightly lower pain scores on average with less variability, which may suggest a more consistent effect of the active treatment pain reduction.
Sham tDCS + TENS displays more variation, potentially indicating that participants’ responses were less predictable without the active tDCS component.

Next Steps for Data Analysis:
Statistical Testing: Consider conducting a statistical test (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test or t-test) to assess whether the difference in post-treatment NPRS scores between the groups is significant.
Documenting Assumptions: Since I'm making assumptions about the group labels, I need to document this assumption in my analysis summary to clarify that the treatment group assignments are based on observed patterns and logical inference.
* I am basing my assumptions on the article previously provided.

Normality Testing:
Shapiro-Wilk test results indicate that the p-value is 0.056, which is slightly above the typical significance level of 0.05. 
W = 0.8789: This is the test statistic, which indicates how well the data fits a normal distribution. The closer it is to 1, the more normal the data is likely to be.
p = 0.056: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, which means you do not have enough evidence to conclude that the data is not normally distributed.
The output suggests that your data can be considered normally distributed at the 5% significance level. This allows you to proceed with parametric tests (like the t-test) if other assumptions (e.g., homogeneity of variances) are met.

Because the data is borderline normal. let's perform an Anderson-Darling test to investigate:
    If the Anderson-Darling statistic is lower than the critical value at your chosen significance level (e.g., 5%), then the data can be considered normally distributed.
    If the statistic is higher than the critical value, it would indicate that the data is not normally distributed.

Results for Anderson Darling test:
Since the data does not meet normality at the more commonly used significance levels (like 5% and 10%), it’s safer to conclude that the data is not normally distributed overall.
The fact that it’s only normally distributed at the 1% level is generally not strong enough evidence to assume normality for parametric tests (such as a t-test).

For beginning of Whitney-U Test, we need to seperate data based on treatment type:

data['Treatment_Type'] == "Active tDCS + TENS":

This part creates a Boolean condition that checks each row in the Treatment_Type column of the data DataFrame.
For rows where Treatment_Type is equal to "Active tDCS + TENS", it returns True; for all others, it returns False.
data[data['Treatment_Type'] == "Active tDCS + TENS"]:

This part uses the Boolean condition to filter the DataFrame.
data[...] only includes rows where the condition is True, effectively selecting rows where Treatment_Type is "Active tDCS + TENS".
data[data['Treatment_Type'] == "Active tDCS + TENS"]['Change_NPRS']:

After filtering, this part selects just the Change_NPRS column from the filtered rows.
The result is a Series containing the Change_NPRS values for rows where Treatment_Type is "Active tDCS + TENS".
This Series is assigned to the variable active_change.

Mann-Whitney U test result: U = 23.5, p = 0.9464711473599322

The Mann-Whitney U test results indicate:

U = 23.5: This is the U statistic, which reflects the sum of ranks for the two groups being compared.
p = 0.946: The p-value is very high (0.946), much greater than the typical threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance.
Interpretation:
Since the p-value (0.946) is well above 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means:

There is no statistically significant difference between the Change in NPRS scores of the Active tDCS + TENS and Sham tDCS + TENS groups.
Essentially, the results suggest that the changes in pain scores are similar between the two groups, and the treatment (active vs. sham) did not have a significant impact on the outcome.
